# SimpleCompetitions
The aim of this project is to generate an app for a business to hold competitions for customers with a bill of more than $50 during special occassions.
Only one competition can be held at a time.
Each customer can have multiple entries, but he/she will only get the entry with the highest prizes.
There are two competetions, either RandomPickCompetition or LuckyDrawCompetition. 
For the RandomPickCompetition, three entry numbers will be selected as winners.
For the LuckyNumbersCompetition, the number of winners depend on how many matches the entries have with the 7-number lucky entry generated.
The Member and the Bill are read from csv files.
