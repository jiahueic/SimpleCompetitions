# SimpleCompetitions
The aim of this project is to generate an app for a business to hold competitions for customers with a bill of more than $50 during special occassions.<br />

Only one competition can be held at a time.<br />

Each customer can have multiple entries, but he/she will only get the entry with the highest prizes.<br />

There are two competetions, either RandomPickCompetition or LuckyDrawCompetition. <br />

For the RandomPickCompetition, three entry numbers will be selected as winners.<br />

For the LuckyNumbersCompetition, the number of winners depend on how many matches the entries have with the 7-number lucky entry generated.<br />

The Member and the Bill are read from csv files. <br />
